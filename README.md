# Goals of Project
###### The goal is to support the efforts to reduce the death caused by skin cancer. 
###### The primary motivation that drives the project is to use the deep learning technology for the well-being of the people.
###### With the help of this project, we want to reduce the gap between diagnosing and treatment.
###### Successful completion of the project with higher precision on the dataset could better support the dermatological clinic work.
###### The improved accuracy and efficiency of the model can aid to detect skin cancer in the early stages and can help to reduce unnecessary biopsies.
